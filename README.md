# Biblegate bot
[Python Telegram Bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/) for automatically quoting Bible verses in telegram groups. The bot consumes the public domain [bible-api](https://github.com/seven1m/bible_api) API for content. 

## How to use

> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

It also will quote whole chapters in the form 'John 1' and ranges of verses in the form 'John 1:1-5'.
